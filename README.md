MarkusLang
==========

A basic language made up of Markus Lumpe quotes. Written using JavaCC. More to come soon (hopefully!)

## Basics

### Assignment Statements
Assign values, either strings or numbers, to a variable name using `this little piggy [var] is [val]`.

- Numbers are described using the IEEE standard for floating-point values
- Strings are encapsulated using single quotes

For example, `var x = 1` would translate to `this little piggy x is 1`.

### Print Statements
Print the value of a *variable* by providing its name to the statement `what is this thingy [var]?`

For example, `puts x` would translate to `what is this thingy x?`

### Commenting
Use hashes to comment out a line of code.

### Coming Soon...

- If statments,
- loops,
- arrays,
- functions/procedures,
- and more quotes!

## Sample Code

````
